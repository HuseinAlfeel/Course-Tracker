src/
├── components/
│   └── MotivationMascot.js ✅
├── hooks/

├── assets/
│   └── animations/
│       ├── monkey-dancing.json ✅

- ✅ Responsive CSS styling
- ✅ User activity tracking
- ✅ Name storage system

## 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **User logs in** → System calculates leaderboard position
2. **If in bottom 3 or low progress** → Mascot appears with encouragement
3. **If inactive 3+ days** → Sad mascot appears with comeback messages
4. **If new user** → Name prompt appears first
5. **User clicks mascot** → Celebration triggers + personalized feedback
6. **Messages rotate** → Fresh motivation every 8-15 seconds

## 🔄 **Adding Real Animations**

### **Option 1: Use your .lottie files**
1. Place `monkey-dancing.lottie` and `sad-circle.lottie` in `/src/assets/animations/`
2. Update imports in `MotivationMascot.js`:
```javascript
import { DotLottieReact } from '@dotlottie/react-player';
import monkeyAnimation from '../assets/animations/monkey-dancing.lottie';
```

### **Option 2: Use JSON animations**
1. Download JSON versions from LottieFiles
2. Replace placeholder files
3. Keep current setup (already working!)

## 🎉 **User Experience Impact**

### **Before**: Users quietly fall behind without support
### **After**: 
- Personal cheerleader knows their name
- Encouraging messages tailored to their situation
- Interactive mascot provides instant motivation
- Last place users get special VIP treatment
- Inactive users get gentle nudges to return
